" However, the deal was that the given stuff where to be returned back to the lake after certain period \n" +
"of time.", "After every prayer, if the deity deems a person worthy, they would give them a required stuff which was\n" +
"requested. Poor families who could not afford utensils, decoration items, money etc. for wedding or \n" +
"funeral were given adequate to perform their duties.", "People were helped to perform marriage ceremony etc. the lake god was " +
"gracious for anyone in need.", "One Day, a rich man in the village found out this the tribal ritual and performed a prayer to give him wealth" +
"\nto pay his debt, but after gaining the wealth he didn't return what was given. The trust between the deity \nand prayer was broken.",
"The deity was furious and it cursed the greedy man and his family. The cursed family lost their wealth \nas the days went by," +
"and family members started to die one after another.", "These made everyone in the village and the tribe paranoid and isolated." +
    "People feared the goddess wrath\n and they slowly stopped worshipping for the gifts. People who have been worshipping" +
    "the goddess prayed\nfor help but she did not respond their cry.","It is said because of that incident, the Dhimal tribe " +
    "got together as one tribe and formed a 'Dhimal Samaj'\n to help each other. A foundation to help each other in need " +
    " was established to provide manpower,\n tools and financial support during all the ceremonies. This community established at 1800 still exists today."];
