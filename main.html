        &ensp;&ensp; The Native region of Dhimal ethnic groups resides at the end of the Eastern region of Nepal called
        Jhapa; there are some populations of groups scattered over other region but majority lives at Jhapa. Jhapa lies at
        the lower region extending to the lower mountain region, where the climate is tropical. The lower flat land and
        the tropical climate have greatly affected in the evolution of the culture and physical attributes of the tribes.

    <img src = "dhimal/pic1.png " alt = "Dhimal Native" class = "center">
    <p class="stylePara">
        &ensp;&ensp; Dhimal is a Sino-Tibetan speaking ethnic group, a native tribal group of Nepal.
        The language is closely related to the aboriginal language of the Himalayas. Before the unification of the
        nation, Dhimal were a nomadic tribes. However, as the time progressed, they located to the eastern region of Nepal. Their appearance
        resembles closely to that of the Tibetan or asian descent, and darker skin color. The animistic religion as well as the cultural heritage,
        and language has survived even after the great unification of Nepal by late King Prithivi Naryan Shah. The Dhimal kingdom was destroyed and
        Hinduism was injected into the culture because of the new regime. Resistance and courage shown by the old ancestor helped preserve the culture, and
        old artifacts. However, the written language practice was lost completely, found only in the stone tablets which till today no one could decipher.
